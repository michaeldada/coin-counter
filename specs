Logic Specs

ability to input a single word              *
input: word(string), output: word(string)   *

get a list of potential anagrams *
input: multiple words, output: verify input *

check input against one candidate
input: candidate, output: boolean are all the letters matching

check input against all other candidates
input: candidate, output: boolean are all the letters matching

Logic for candidate checking:
take a candidate list item and put in character array
take input and put it in a character array
sort each array alphabetically
check and count occurances of 1 character from first array, in 2nd array
check and count remaining characters from 1st array, until first array end of file
(1 full match)
(2 partial match > 2 characters in common)
(# of occurances in checked word IE racecar has two occurances of car)
return these things:
return string(s) that specifies full match
return string(s) that connstitute partial matches
return # occurances of partial and full matches if greater than 1
